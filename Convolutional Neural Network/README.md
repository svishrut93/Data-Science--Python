This folder contains an implementation of a CNN using Keras. 

The problem is a classification problem, about identifying an image as a 1) Cat or 2)Dog.


The Dataset contains 10,000 images.

Training Data : 8000 images ----4000 cats / 4000 dogs
Test Dat : 2000 images ---------1000 cats / 1000 dogs 

This code is for my own quick reference and contains a generic template for any CNNs. 

I will keep tuning the parameters and making the network deeper to improve the classification accuracy.

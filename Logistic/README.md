<h1>Logistic Regression </h2>

The dataset used to perform logistic regression is the famous Titanic dataset from kaggle
While linear regression is useful for predicting continuous values (like housing prices in the previous folder), we cant use it for problems like binary classification 
The model wont be a good fit. 

So we try to solve binary classification using logistic regression. 

The dataset csv files are available for download in this folder. 

This prroject is a work in progress. Please come back in a few days.

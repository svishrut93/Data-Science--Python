<h1> K means Clustering </h1> 

This folder contains k-means over a cricket dataset. <br>
The dataset contains ages and average runs made by cricket teams of 2 countries : India and Australia  <br> 

The aim is to form clusters that can identify the players correctly to each team. <br> 

I tried this with k =2 and k = 3 clusters.<br> 

And the got the below results.<br>

This result was obtained using sci kit learn. <br>

I will also be implementing a k means clustering from scratch without using a library.<br>

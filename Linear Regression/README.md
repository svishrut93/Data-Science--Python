<h1>Linear Regression : Prediction of housing Prices</h1>

The dataset used for this demonstration is the file : USA_Housing.csv.
This is an artificially created dataset provided by data scientist instructor :Jose Portilla. 
I have attached a copy of the file. 


The process of performing linear regression follows the steps...
1. Import dataset.<\br>
2.Explore the data using various graphs and data visualization strategies. <\br>
3.Divide data into training and testing sets 
4. Train the model on the data.
5. Perform predictions 
6.Evaluate the results using common evaluation metrics  - Mean absolute error/Mean squared error/Root mean squared error


The output can be read from the out-put file 
The visualization graphs can be viewed in the visualizations folder.

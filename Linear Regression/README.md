<h1>Linear Regression : Prediction of housing Prices</h1>

The dataset used for this demonstration is the file : USA_Housing.csv.
This is an artificially created dataset provided by data scientist instructor :Jose Portilla. 
I have attached a copy of the file. 


The process of performing linear regression follows the steps...

1. Import dataset

2. Explore the data using various graphs and data visualization strategies

3. Divide data into training and testing sets

4. Train the model on the data

5. Perform predictions

6. Evaluate the results using common evaluation metrics  - Mean absolute error/Mean squared error/Root mean squared error


The output can be read from the out-put file 
The visualization graphs can be viewed in the visualizations folder.

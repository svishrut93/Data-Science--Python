<h1> Artificial Neural Network with Keras </h1> 

The dataset used is the business problem described by the file “Churn_Modelling.xlsx” <br> 
We use the neural network to build a classifier model. <br> 
The classifier is used to predict wether a certain customer will exit a bank or not. <br> 
I have used two activation functions in  this deep learning model. <br>

<h3> Input side : Rectifier function </h3> 
<h3> Output side : Sigmoid function </h3> 

The sigmoid function makes a prediction of probability that a certain customer will leave a bank. 
I use 12 independent variables as input into the neural network. 

The model gives an accuracy of 84%. 


Code can be found in file called ANN_10.py<br>
Outputs of the training and testing can be seen in the output file.
